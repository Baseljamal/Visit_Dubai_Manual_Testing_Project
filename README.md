# Visit_Dubai_Manual_Testing_Project
In this project, I tested a mobile named Visit Dubai which presents the best locations to visit in Dubai in different fields.
I focused on testing registration, login, search functionality, booking functionality and more.
I wrote 15 test cases for different areas in the app.
I found 5 bugs and reported them in a well-structured bug report.
I used functional, UI, Logic and Usability testing.
